//Pseudocode:
//1. Assign three variables. Each variable contains the corresponding result of calculation using a unique arithmetic operator. Each equal to one of the three codes in the combination.
//2. Create a dialog box displaying the vault codes and the text in a popup dialog.
//3. Uploaded secure the vault to GitHub.

let sum = 0;
let newNumber = 10;
sum = sum + newNumber;
console.log(sum);
//expect output: The sum is equal to 10, giving you the first variable to the combination.

let sum2 = 10;
let newNumber2 = 4;
sum2 *= newNumber2;
console.log(sum2);
//expected output: Sum2 is multiplied by newNumber2, giving the second variable to the combination.

let sum3 = 40;
let newNumber3 = 1;
sum3--;
console.log(sum3);
//expected output: Sum3 is subtracted by newNumber3, giving you the third and final variable to the combination.

const dialog =
  "have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:";
let number1 = "10";
let number2 = "40";
let number3 = "39";


//expected output: Alert popup in browser, showing the dialog + the number combinations.

alert(`You  ${dialog}  ${number1}  -  ${number2}  -  ${number3}`)
//expected output: message stating the secret combination
